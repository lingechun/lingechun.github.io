**Gechun Lin**. "Using Generative AI to Extract Emphasis Frames." 
<!-- <details>
<summary><b>Abstract</b></summary>

Framing analysis is at the core of studies in political communication. The current literature relies mainly on topic modeling and dictionary approaches to identify frames from texts. However, users cannot control desired topic outputs in unsupervised models, such as LDA and STM; moreover, the resulting groups of keywords lack semantic contexts for exploring how things are framed. Dictionary approaches also have limitations: existing ones would miss novel frames in evolving discourse, and creating new dictionaries is resource-intensive. Instead, I propose a new method that follows three steps—quote, summarize, and name—to extract frames using generative AI. I apply this method to re-examine the framing of smoking ban policy at the issue-definition stage during its diffusion across 49 US states. Compared to traditional topic models, the new method produces more semantically interpretable high-level document features and accurately identifies the use of complex frames. Empirically, this results in the discovery of meaningful subframes and reveals different patterns of coexisting frames.

**Gechun Lin**. "Using Cross-Encoders to Measure the Similarity of Short Texts in Political Science." 
<!-- <details>
<summary><b>Abstract</b></summary>

In many settings, scholars wish to estimate the similarity of political texts. However, the most commonly used methods in political science struggle to identify when two texts convey the same meaning as they rely too heavily on identifying words that appear in both documents. This limitation is especially salient when the underlying documents are short, an increasingly prevalent form of textual data in modern political research. Building on recent advances in computer science, I introduce to political science cross-encoders for precise estimates of semantic similarity in short texts. Scholars can use either off-the-shelf versions or build a customized model. I illustrate this approach in three examples applied to social messages generated in a telephone game, news headlines about US Supreme Court decisions, and Facebook posts from members of Congress. I show that cross-encoders, which utilize pair-level embeddings, offer superior performance across tasks relative to word-based and sentence-level embedding approaches.
