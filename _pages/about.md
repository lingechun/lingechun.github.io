Hello, I am a Ph.D. candidate in Political Science at Washington University in St. Louis. My educational background is highly interdisciplinary, encompassing degrees in law, political science, and statistics. I am currently on the 2024 Fall academic job market.

My job market paper has been accepted by the *American Journal of Political Science*. Additionally, my collaborative projects have been published as a book chapter in the *Oxford Handbook of Methodological Pluralism in Political Science*, accepted by the *Journal of Theoretical Politics*, and invited for revise and resubmit to *Humanities and Social Science Communications*. For more details, please refer to my CV.

My primary field is computational social science, with a particular emphasis on the applications of cutting-edge NLP models and AI tools in measuring political concepts. My dissertation leverages the most recent advancements in (large) language models to address the limitations of traditional methods in estimating text similarity and conducting automated frame analysis. The innovative techniques I introduce to political scientists have broad applications in studying polarization, information transmission, and media framing.

I also maintain a collaborative research agenda on topics in political communication. These works utilize state-of-the-art language models to draw insights from massive corpora, including studies on party rhetorical (dis)unity in the U.S. Congressional speeches and the online expressions of social media users regarding U.S. foreign policy. While my current research is predominantly focused on the American context, the methodologies I employ are readily applicable to studies in non-U.S. settings.
