Hello, I am a Ph.D. candidate in Political Science at Washington University in St. Louis, currently on the academic job market.

My primary field is computational social science, with a particular emphasis on the applications of cutting-edge NLP models and AI tools in measuring political concepts. My dissertation leverages the most recent advancements in (large) language models to address the limitations of traditional methods in estimating text similarity and conducting automated frame analysis. The innovative techniques I introduce to political scientists have broad applications in studying polarization, information transmission, and media framing. 


Building on my expertise in advanced computational methods, I maintain a substantive research agenda on  topics in political communication. I apply the advanced methods proposed in my dissertation to examine how judicial decisions and media slant affect the diversity of media coverage of the US Supreme Court. My collaborative works also include studies on party rhetorical (dis)unity in the U.S. Congress and the online expressions of social media users regarding U.S. foreign policy. While my current research is predominantly focused on the American context, the methodologies I employ are readily applicable to studies in non-U.S. settings.

My educational background is highly interdisciplinary, encompassing degrees in law, political science, and statistics. My solo-authored work has been accepted by the American Journal of Political Science. Additionally, my collaborative projects have been published as a book chapter in the Oxford Handbook of Methodological Pluralism in Political Science, accepted by the Journal of Theoretical Politics, and invited for revise and resubmit to Humanities and Social Science Communications. For more details, please refer to my CV.
