My name is Gechun Lin. I am Ph.D. candidate in Political Science at Washington University in St. Louis. I have earned my B.A. in Law from Sun Yat-sen University and LL.M and J.S.D. in Law from Washington University in St. Louis. I will be on the job market in 2024 Fall. My primary field is computational social science, with a particular focus on the applications of state-of-the-art NLP models and AI tools in measuring political concepts. The methods I introduce contribute to the substantive studies in political communication, polarization, and policy framing.
